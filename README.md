# Counter-Strike: Source ‚Äì Source SDK 2013 Port (WIP)

This is an ongoing effort to port **Counter-Strike: Source** to the **2013 Source SDK (Multiplayer branch, old version)**. The project is currently **playable**, but comes with **many bugs and rough edges**.

We hope this serves as a base for a community cleanup and polish effort. 

There are also plans to port this to the newer 2013 SDK, but no playable builds yet.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This project is **incomplete and experimental**. Some features may not work correctly, and setup requires manual intervention and problem-solving.

## üîß Building the Project (Windows Only)

> Linux build support is untested. Contributions to help with that are welcome!

1. Run `createcstrikeprojects.bat` located in `\mp\src\`
2. Open the generated solution in **Visual Studio 2022**
3. **Clean** the solution
4. **Build** the solution in `Release` mode
5. Output will be placed in:  
   `\mp\game\mod_cstrike\`
6. Copy the `mod_cstrike` folder to your **Source SDK Base 2013 Multiplayer** `sourcemods` directory

## ‚öôÔ∏è Game Setup Caveats

Before launching the mod, be aware of the following:

- You need Counter-Strike: Source content:
  - I couldn‚Äôt get the proper mounting from the old CSS branch to work.
  - Instead, I manually copied CSS content files into `custom/`.
  - I also commented out the CSS mount paths in `gameinfo.txt` to prevent errors.

- You'll also need the **GUI files** from Counter-Strike: Source to prevent crashes or missing UI elements.

- The game will not run under the new SDK, when you have SDK 2013 MP installed, you'll need it set to `previous2021`. Stay tuned for a possible fix for this soon.

- **Bots are supported**:
  - A `botprofile.db` file is included under the `/custom/` folder of this repository.
  - This is for testing and may be improved or moved later.
  
- **Bot Radio Chatter** causes **crashes** ‚Äî set it to **Off** in the audio settings.

---

## üìå Known Issues

- CSS content mounting doesn't work out of the box
- Various graphical and gameplay bugs
- Crashes with bot audio chatter
- Missing or broken UI elements without proper GUI files

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Future Plans

- Clean up code and assets
- Improve content mounting process
- Support Linux
- Port to **Source SDK 2013 (new branch)** for better toolchain and compatibility
